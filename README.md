## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript


### What I learned
Creating a container and appending it to a "parent" is very useful, and intuitive.

### Continued development

The course is getting more and more interesting. I'm very surprised how educational coding a chrome extension (witha real world use) can be.


### Useful resources

- [Create DOM Element](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_span.asp) - Simple, but helpful. By the way, no need to use capital letters between quotes
